Attack 1 is a DDoS attack on a live website. 

Materials: 
	Windows or Linux Test Environment
	LOIC.exe
	Live testing website

Premise:
	Once the LOIC software is downloaded a configured, a DDos (Distributed Denial of Service) Attack will be launched on www.cyntax.org, which is my personal website hosted by GoDaddy.

Attack Details: 
	A Distributed Denial of Service attack is where the software sends numerous packets
of data to a web server and overloads it to the point where the website stops working for
the intended recipients.

Hypothesis:
	Once attack is launched, my website should render slowly or even fail to load.

Conclustion:
	After initial attack, access to the website seemed unphased. Will consider alt
website for testing that may be on a standalone.
